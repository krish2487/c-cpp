Visible Light Communication (VLC) is an in-door wireless communication which utilize visible light as the transmission medium. The light source for VLC comes from LED lamps. Nowadays LED lamps are commonly used in our daily life. With VLC technology, the illumination function and the data communication function can be combined in one device.
In this research, a System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture for VLC is proposed. For the VLC part, several IP cores are designed to implement VLC PHY layer based on OFDM modulation. The IP cores are designed with AXI4 protocol standard, so it supports the reuse methodology which is usually used in SoC design process. System integration is done by connecting the IP cores to the ARM Cortex-A9 processor, so the IP cores can be accessed from the software. This integration is carried out in the Xilinx Zynq-7000 All Programmable SoC.
